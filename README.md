# EECS3461

These two assignments was group work by three students. I designed the UI and UX and did part of code with my group member.

Assignment 1:
The goal is to create a Java application for a Parking Permit Kiosk. Like most kiosks, interaction is via a touch screen. The system’s keyboard is not used. For this assignment, we’ll use point-and-click operations with the mouse to simulate a touch screen.

Assignment 2: 
The goal is to create drawing application using Java. The application should include a variety of drawing capabilities, as typically found in commercial drawing applications.  These include, but are not limited to, drawing objects such as squares, circles, lines, etc., free-hand drawing, inserting text; inserting an image from a file, operations for specifying line color, and thickness, and fill color; zoom in, zoom out, undo; save; save as…, open, etc.
